The purpose of this analysis is to determine bike utiliztion for users in New York City.  We used Tableau to organize and develop visual aids to assist in the analysis.  We found that August was the peak month for users, and used that data set to formulate our worksheets.  The results of the analysis show that there are more male users of the bikesharing program.  The August Peak Hours shows the hours of the day that bikes were used.  The Peak hours in August is between 5pm and 7pm, with males leading in users.

An additional visual aid was developed for bike utilization.  This is important for determining what bikes should are being used the most.  This worksheet in conjunctions with the peak hours worksheet could help indicate the bikes needed for repair AND the most efficient time to repair them.
